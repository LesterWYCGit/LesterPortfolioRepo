Objective:
To identify recurring seasonal patterns in the monthly returns of corn and wheat futures, and evaluate cross-commodity relationships for trading or risk management.
Why:

2.	Compute monthly returns from adjusted close prices.
3.	Aggregate returns by calendar month (Janâ€“Dec).
4.	Compare average monthly returns for corn vs wheat.
5.	Visualize results in a bar chart for interpretation.


Applications:
â€¢	Hedging: Manage exposure by offsetting long corn with short wheat when seasonality suggests divergence.
â€¢	Trading: Anticipate planting/harvest rallies and position accordingly.
â€¢	Risk Management: Identify months with higher volatility to adjust margin and exposure.
