🌾Commodity Correlation & Hedging Analysis

This project analyzes the correlations among key commodities—Soybean Oil (ZL=F), Crude Oil (CL=F), and Corn (ZC=F)—to provide insights for hedging strategies. Hedgers and traders can leverage these correlations to manage cross-market risks effectively, particularly in the vegetable oils and biofuel sectors.

Key Features
•	Data Source: Historical daily adjusted closing prices from Yahoo Finance.
•	Returns Calculation: Daily percentage changes for each commodity.
•	Correlation Analysis: Correlation matrix and heatmap to visualize relationships.
•	Cross-Market Hedging Insight: Understand how movements in one market may affect another.

🔎 Interpretation

Interpretation
1.	Diagonal = 1.00
o	By definition, each commodity has perfect correlation with itself.


2.	Crude Oil ↔ Corn (0.09)
o	Extremely weak correlation.
o	Indicates that crude oil shocks (geopolitics, OPEC decisions, energy demand) have almost no direct impact on corn, which is mostly weather- and harvest-driven.
o	Suggests crude oil futures are not a useful hedge for corn exposure.


3.	Crude Oil ↔ Soybean Oil (0.14)
o	Weak but slightly positive correlation.
o	Some link may stem from soybean oil’s role in biodiesel—energy price increases can occasionally lift vegetable oil demand.
o	However, at 0.14, this relationship is unreliable for hedging or speculation.


4.	Corn ↔ Soybean Oil (0.33)
o	The strongest relationship in this matrix, though still only moderate.
o	Reflects agricultural linkages: corn and soybeans compete for acreage, and both are used in food/feed and renewable fuel markets.
o	This means corn price movements could give partial signals for soybean oil trends, offering limited cross-hedging potential.

📊 Hedging Implications
•	High correlation (>0.7): Ideal for cross-hedging, but not observed here.
•	Moderate correlation (0.3–0.5): Only corn ↔ soybean oil falls into this range, suggesting some hedging benefit but with basis risk.
•	Low correlation (<0.3): Dominates this matrix, highlighting the need for commodity-specific hedges rather than proxies.

🌐 Strategy Takeaway
•	Crude oil prices should not be relied upon as a hedge for agricultural commodities in this dataset.
•	Corn and soybean oil display the only meaningful link, so traders can monitor this pair for acreage-driven substitution effects.
•	Broader vegetable oil markets (soy, palm, sunflower) may provide better cross-hedging efficiency than crude oil or corn alone.
