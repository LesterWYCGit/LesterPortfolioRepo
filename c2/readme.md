üìä Risk Analysis: Soybean Oil Futures (ZL=F)


Data
‚Ä¢	Source: Yahoo Finance
‚Ä¢	Instrument: Soybean Oil Futures (ZL=F)
‚Ä¢	Period: 5 years of daily data


Methodology
‚Ä¢	Approach: Historical simulation of daily returns
‚Ä¢	Metrics: Value-at-Risk (VaR) and Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) at 95% confidence level


Results
‚Ä¢	VaR (95%): ‚âà -3.17%
‚Üí With 95% confidence, daily losses will not exceed 3.17%. On ~1 in 20 days, losses may be worse.
‚Ä¢	CVaR (95%): ‚âà -4.85%
‚Üí If losses breach the 95% threshold, the average loss in that tail is about 4.85%.


Interpretation
‚Ä¢	VaR provides a threshold for ‚Äúnormal‚Äù downside risk.
‚Ä¢	CVaR captures tail risk, quantifying how severe losses are when extreme events occur.
‚Ä¢	Both are essential for position sizing, capital allocation, and hedging strategies in vegetable oil trading.


Visualization: Histogram of Daily Returns
‚Ä¢	Histogram bars: Distribution of historical daily returns.
‚Ä¢	Red dashed line (VaR 95%): Marks the cutoff where the worst 5% of outcomes begin.
‚Ä¢	Dark red dashed line (CVaR 95%): Represents the average of those worst 5% losses.
‚Ä¢	This dual visualization highlights both the boundary of typical losses (VaR) and the expected depth of extreme losses (CVaR).


Trader‚Äôs Takeaway
‚Ä¢	A 3.17% daily VaR means traders should size positions to withstand that level of fluctuation under normal conditions.
‚Ä¢	The 4.85% CVaR highlights that in a stress scenario, actual losses could be much deeper than VaR suggests.
‚Ä¢	For hedgers (e.g., food manufacturers, biodiesel producers), this helps set hedging ratios and margin buffers.
‚Ä¢	For speculators, it provides a benchmark for leverage decisions and when to cut losses during market shocks.
