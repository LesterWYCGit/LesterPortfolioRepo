📊 Soybean Oil Futures – Stress Test (Scenario Analysis)

• Data: Latest soybean oil futures price (ZL=F from Yahoo Finance).
• Method: Simulated a $10m long position under ±10% price shocks.

Insight:
o If prices fall 10%, position loses $1m.
o If prices rise 10%, position gains $1m.

• Relevance: Provides clear, business-focused view of downside risk and upside potential. Helps risk managers, traders, and executives assess exposure size and decide whether to hedge or adjust positions.

Interpretation of Soybean Oil Stress Test

Overall Exposure
• A $10m position is very sensitive: even small shocks (±10%) create large swings (±$1m).
• This highlights both the risk and opportunity of leveraged commodity positions.

Downside Scenario (–10% Shock)
• Loss of $1m demonstrates the scale of financial risk.
• Risk managers would evaluate whether this aligns with the firm’s risk appetite.
• Could trigger discussions of hedging or position reduction.

Upside Scenario (+10% Shock)
• Gain of $1m shows potential reward if prices move favorably.
• Traders might choose to hold exposure if fundamentals (e.g., supply concerns, demand growth) support bullish outlook.

Current Market State
• Soybean oil trades at ~$52.48 (as of Sept 2025).
• Stress testing at ±10% gives a clear sense of short-term risk/reward balance.
• For a more robust view, further stress tests (–20%, +30%) or cross-commodity shocks (e.g., crude oil down while soybean oil flat) can be added.

Summary for Case Study
This stress test example demonstrates how scenario analysis translates market moves into business impact.
• Risk managers value its simplicity: “what if prices drop 10%?” becomes “we lose $1m.”
• Traders see the balance between downside risk and upside opportunity.
• Executives gain a clear picture of exposure size and potential financial consequences.

👉 This makes scenario analysis a practical tool for bridging technical analysis and business decision-making in commodity markets.
