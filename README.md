üîç About This Repository & [Me](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lester-wee-yi-cheng-6a0074185/)

This repository is designed to showcase how I approach common data challenges that firms encounter, including data aggregation, anomaly detection, and data quality issues such as duplicates, inconsistent formats, or missing values. Using Python and VS Code, I demonstrate practical steps to identify, clean, and validate data, ensuring that it is reliable and actionable for analysis or decision-making. I also focus on documenting the workflow clearly, which is a critical part of data governance ensuring that others can understand and reproduce the process, while maintaining a level of transaprency. 

While some firms may use different software or platforms, I have a general understanding of standard workflows, and I‚Äôm actively developing my statistics knowledge to better interpret trends, measure variability, and support informed decisions. Through these projects, I aim to show not only technical skills but also a thoughtful approach to real-world data problems, which includes knowing when to automate solutions, when to collaborate with other teams, and how to prioritize data quality to support business objectives.

üéØIn short:

Technical execution: Python, VS Code, NumPy, Pandas, Data Wrangling
Data governance awareness: documenting workflows, reproducibility
Analytical mindset: recognizing anomalies, thinking about statistics
Practical business sense: when to automate vs involve others, decision-support focus
