üîç About This Repository & [Me](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lester-wee-yi-cheng-6a0074185/)

This repository is designed to showcase how I approach common data challenges that firms encounter, including data aggregation, anomaly detection, and data quality issues such as duplicates, inconsistent formats, or missing values. Using Python and VS Code, I demonstrate practical steps to identify, clean, and validate data, ensuring that it is reliable and actionable for analysis or decision-making. I also focus on documenting the workflow clearly, which is a critical part of data governance ensuring that others can understand and reproduce the process, while maintaining a level of transaprency. 

While some firms may use different software or platforms, I have a general understanding of standard workflows, and I‚Äôm actively developing my statistics knowledge to better interpret trends, measure variability, and support informed decisions. Through these projects, I aim to show not only technical skills but also a thoughtful approach to real-world data problems, which includes knowing when to automate solutions, when to collaborate with other teams, and how to prioritize data quality to support business objectives.

üéØIn short:

Technical execution: Python, VS Code, NumPy, Pandas, Data Wrangling
Data governance awareness: documenting workflows, reproducibility
Analytical mindset: recognizing anomalies, thinking about statistics
Practical business sense: when to automate vs involve others, decision-support focus

Folder: LoanRejectionApproval 
Dataset Source: [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bsugiarto9/loan-status-prediction-with-added-nans)
üìå Summary
Imported loan application data with Pandas, checked for missing values and duplicates, and flagged applications with incomplete information by pushing them to the bottom for review. While no deep insights were derived, this project demonstrates the ability to wrangle and clean raw financial data to ensure accuracy and completeness, to be incompliance with Regulatory/ Compliance Checks.
